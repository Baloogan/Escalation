            If the other side does not look as though it is going to be reasonable, one can do more than drop hints of trouble to come. One can perform legal but unfair, unfriendly, discourteous, inequitable, or threatening acts to put pressure on an opponent—to carry unmistakable (or at least relatively clear) messages. Acts by one government to seek redress for, or prevent recurrence of, an undesired act by another government are often called "retortions." We will restrict that term to acts that are quite hostile (see Rung 7) and exclude the kind of thing that could occur, for example, in an intensified titfor-tat argument between the U.S. and the Common Market. At this lower level one can: (1) recall an ambassador for lengthy consultation; (2) refuse to facilitate negotiations on other issues; (3) make overtures to the other side's enemies; (4) denounce a treaty; (5) make a moderate but unmistakable legal or economic reprisal; (6) push resolutions in the U.N. against the other side; (7) replace an official in a key spot by one who is known to be "hard" or "tough"; (8) start a violent publicity campaign, encourage mass meetings, "spontaneous" public demonstrations, and so on. If the public becomes involved, the tone of castigations of the "enemy" will tend to be shriller than before. Or most of the accompanying communications may be made privately. The private threat, though, may carry less weight because the side making it has revealed an unwillingness to make a public commitment. However, if the other side yields to a private threat or accepts some face-saving compromise, it has not lost as much prestige as might otherwise have been the case.

            It is also possible for government officials to arrange for deliberate newspaper leaks. This can be done in a number of ways— from the formal public gesture (as discussed at Rung 3) to the relatively private and "unofficial" acts. Even in the former case, when everyone knows the source of the leak, a government is not usually as committed as if a senior official had made a formal speech (as in Rung 3). Thus, a semiofficial Tass dispatch or an interpretive column in The New York Times is still at Rung 2.

            Political and military gestures can be part of an escalation process and still be justified or motivated for reasons other than escalation. The creation of the NATO alliance, an alliance clearly designed to fight a defensive battle against the Soviets if need be, was a military as well as a political and diplomatic act to counter the Berlin blockade and the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia. Yet it could also be justified as a reaction to postwar technology, to the existence of two superpowers and of a power vacuum in Western Europe.
