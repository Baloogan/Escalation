            We do not generally include in this category a press conference or even the usual speech in which some executive or senior decision-maker may draw an opponent's attention to the fact that one will react in a way the opponent will not like. To be at Rung 3, the declaration has to be of such a nature that it is almost impossible to argue that a binding and honorable commitment has not been made. Typical of such a commitment would be a resolution formally passed by the legislature and concurred in by the executive, a solemn executive declaration in which there was a deliberate attempt to heighten the importance of the occasion, a formal diplomatic communication between the heads of state, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>Such declarations go much further than Rung 2 in demonstrating resolve and commitment, but they need not be deliberately hostile. They may provide merely a simple notice to other states of a nation's policy in a certain geographical or other area, as the Monroe Doctrine did; or the declaration may deliberately avoid a precise statement of its applicability and limitations. An example of such ambiguity could be the Congressional Resolution of January 28, 1955, which authorized in advance any military action the President might take outside Formosa proper and the Pescadores in order to defend Formosa, without actually committing the U.S. to take any action. Another example could be the resolution passed by Congress in August, 1964, at the request of President Johnson as a result of the escalation in the Gulf of Tonkin: Congress resolved that "the United States is, therefore, prepared, as the President determines, to take all necessary steps including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom."</p>

        <p>One of the most famous Rung 3-type gestures was the guarantee by the British to Poland in 1939 that they would declare war on Germany if Hitler invaded Poland.</p>

        <p>Such a proclamation or resolution is usually a warning to a potential opponent not to climb farther up the escalation ladder, at least in the area covered by the announcement. The declaration may be thought of as pre-emptive or preventive escalation which tries to forestall further escalation by the opponent. The possibility of such pre-emptive escalation falls into the general category of "rationality-of-irrationality" and "committal" strategies.</p>
