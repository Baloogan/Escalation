<h2>Ostensible Crisis</h2>
<p>In this stage, one or both sides assert, more or less openly and explicitly, that unless a given dispute is resolved in the immediate future, the rungs of the escalation ladder will be climbed. Vague or explicit threats may be made that one will take extreme measures rather than back down. These threats are made credible by various hints as to how important the government considers the issues. There may be officially inspired newspaper stories to the effect that the chief of state takes a serious view of the matter. There may be explicit announcements or speeches by other important officials—but none of them of the bridge-burning variety, none deliberately designed to make it really difficult for these same officials to back down later.</p>

<p>Extremist groups may be urging decisive action, and there may even be newspaper headlines, but most people probably will not be worried. The "crisis" looks more like a "play" to them than a serious endeavor to put pressure on the opponent, although decisionmakers may also join, more or less openly, in the "play-acting." However, neutral, "hysterical," or alienated groups may become extremely concerned. Thus, there may be pressures put on either or both sides to meet or to moderate their demands, or at least to have them mediated, perhaps through United Nations or other international auspices. In fact, one of the main reasons for the "play-acting" is to raise such apprehensions and generate such pressures.</p>

<p>We might conjecture, for example, that since Khrushchev's November, 1958, speech (or ultimatum), the Berlin crisis has vacillated from an ostensible crisis to a real one, but has been more ostensible than real. Similarly, we would argue that in the escalation in the Gulf of Tonkin in the summer of 1964, once the United States had carried out its raid and announced that it was satisfied with this reprisal, the crisis dropped from a real one to an ostensible one, even though most of the language used for some weeks afterward was designed to sound appropriate to a real crisis, particularly in the releases from the Chinese Communists.</p>

<p>One real problem in a balance-of-terror environment is that, with time, a nation's decision-makers may become so confident of the stability of the situation that in a real crisis they will misjudge some of the language and acts and take them as "ostensible" rather than real. Making explicit the knowledge that "play-acting" takes place should increase one's skill in recognizing the real thing when it occurs.</p>
