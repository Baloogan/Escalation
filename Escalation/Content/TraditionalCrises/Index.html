<h2>Traditional Crises</h2>
<p>We use the term "intense crisis" to mark a crisis in which a significant number of people actually envisage that nuclear war may really occur, yet nuclear weapons have not yet been employed. Of course, there are many who understand abstractly that nuclear weapons exist and may be used, but in this kind of intense crisis the nuclear incredulity that all of us share would be sharply decreased if not eliminated. The "unreal and hypothetical" nuclear stockpiles that exist would suddenly represent a real threat. This change probably would not come all at once, and it might be a limited development; but a part of the population and most of the decision-makers would acknowledge that a nuclear war might take place—that it was no longer either "unthinkable" or "impossible."</p>
