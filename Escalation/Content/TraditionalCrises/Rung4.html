<h2>Hardening Of Positions—Confrontation Of Wills</h2>
<p>As soon as negotiations take on much more of a coercive than a contractual character, I would argue that we have reached Rung 4. Certainly this is true if either or both of the antagonists attempt to increase the credibility of their resolve and committal by "bridgeburning" acts. These could include a public and irrevocable increase in the stakes or a joining together of other issues—all done with the deliberate purpose of making it harder for the other side to believe that it can make its opponent back down.</p>

<p>In particular, under modern conditions, either side could point out vividly to the other side's population or to its allies the totally destructive character of thermonuclear war. It could now be stressed that nobody would survive, that there is no alternative to peace—with the clear implication that, unless the madmen on the other side come to their senses, all will be lost. Alternatively, one can reassure one's own side by pointing out that the other side is not mad and will therefore back down.</p>

<p>Accompanying this "locking in" process, there may be a great increase of activity at Rungs 2 and 3, such as angry and bitter outbursts in the press against the other side, bellicose or jingoist speeches by prominent individuals or government leaders, possibly even including the chief of state, and detailed speculation on the possible military measures that could be implemented if events proved them necessary—all designed to deter the other side from acting in any way that it might later regret.</p>
