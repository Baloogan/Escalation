<h2>Show Of Force</h2>
<p>As the crisis intensifies, one side or the other may display or draw attention to the fact that it does have the capability to use force if need be. There are various ways of showing such force—direct or indirect, silent or noisy. A direct show of force might be the publicized movement of naval or air units, the mobilization of reserves, provocative military exercises or maneuvers, particularly in sensitive areas, or even the "routine" deployment of naval and military units in such areas. An indirect show of force might be the testing of missiles in a provocative way, the conduct of normal maneuvers but with possibly abnormal publicity, the publicized use of military equipment in "normal" but special maneuvers which in an important way simulate an aspect of an attack possible in the current crisis, and so on.</p>

<p>
    The show of force may be silent, in an attempt to impress directly the other side's decision-makers and military and political advisers without necessarily arousing the general public. Or it may be accompanied by a press campaign and official speeches in which it is specifically stressed that the "enemy's" behavior, or the need to rectify injustice, has "forced us to do what we are doing."
</p>
<p>
    As part of a show of force, practice evacuations for either cadres or population can be ordered, or a limited evacuation for particular cities can be tested. Each side might accompany its demonstrations with public statements about the strategic balance of terror. These can be designed to influence one's own side, one's allies, neutrals, or the opposition. Soviet Premier Khrushchev, for example, usually in contexts that were anything but conciliatory, often pointed out the totally disastrous effects of all-out war and the impossibility of limited war.

<p>
    We, on our side, often point out the enormous superiority we have in weapons. We might amplify these remarks in a Rung 5 crisis by making public relatively detailed calculations on how the United States could conduct a controlled counterforce campaign, and the extreme unlikelihood that the Soviets would actually indulge in a countercity campaign in the face of overwhelming U.S. superiority. As I will discuss later in connection with military central wars (Rungs 32-38), a credible counter-counterthreat can make a threat more credible. We could even announce that if the Soviet leaders did not understand these nuclear subtleties before, we believe they do now.

<p>
    The Soviets, on their side, would possibly reply much as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The American press notes that the strategy of "counterforce" has been approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the White House and interprets it as some kind of recommendation to the Soviet Union concerning "rules" for the conduct of nuclear war.</p>

    <p>The political implication of this strategy is that by conducting a so-called "controlled" nuclear war, the destruction of the capitalist system can be prevented. However, the illusory nature of these hopes is too obvious. If nuclear war is unleashed by the militarists, then no strategy, however it may be called, will save imperialism from destruction.</p>

    <p>
        As a matter of fact, how can everyone be "convinced" of the necessity to adhere to the "new rules" that nuclear strikes should be launched only against military objectives when the majority of such objectives are located in large or smaller cities and populated places. . . .
    </p>
    <p> Similar admissions . . . also . . . unwittingly expose the aggressive nature of the strategy of "counterforce." This strategy . . . stems primarily from the necessity for preventive war. A strategy which contemplates attaining victory through the destruction of the armed forces cannot stem from the idea of "retaliatory blow"; it stems from preventive actions and the achievement of surprise.</p>
